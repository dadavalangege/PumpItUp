# Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table challenge by DrivenData

Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, we must predict which pumps are functional, need some repairs, and which don't work at all. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

This repo contains my EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering and modelling work for this DrivenData competition, where I currently hold a top 4% score (0.8238/1 score). It is also included all the experiments and iterations I have done before reaching my final model.
